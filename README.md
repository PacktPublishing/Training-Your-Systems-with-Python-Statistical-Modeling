This is the code repository for [Training Your Systems with Python Statistical Modeling [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/training-your-systems-python-statistical-modeling-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788293402), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Training Your Systems with Python Statistical Learning aims to give viewers a working knowledge of machine learning and statistical analysis using Python and its packages.

 The course focuses on using Scikit-Learn, statsmodels, and scipy for statistical learning, while using NumPy and Pandas for storing and managing data and matplotlib for visualization. The course is light on theory and heavy on examples, with concepts being introduced then demonstrated with code and data examples.

 At the end of the course, viewers should have a working knowledge of machine learning models and concepts and how to implement these models in Python.
