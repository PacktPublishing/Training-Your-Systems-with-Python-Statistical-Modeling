    "A **random forest** is a collection of decision trees that each individually make a prediction for an observation. Each tree is formed from a random subset of the training set. The majority decision among the trees is then the predicted value of an observation. Random forests are an example of **ensemble methods**, where the predictions of individual classifiers are used for decision making.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **scikit-learn** class `RandomForestClassifier` can be used for training random forests. For random forests we may consider an additional hyperparameter to tree depth: the number of trees to train. Each tree should individually be shallow, and having more trees should lead to less overfitting.\n",
