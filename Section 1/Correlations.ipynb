    "**Correlation** is a measure of how strongly two variables are related to one another. The most common measure of correlation is the **Pearson correlation coefficient**, which, for two sets of paired data $x_i$ and $y_i$ is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r = \\frac{1}{n - 1}\\sum_{i = 1}^n \\left(\\frac{x_i - \\bar{x}}{s_x}\\right)\\left(\\frac{y_i - \\bar{y}}{s_y}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$r$ is a number between 1 and -1, with $r > 0$ indicating a positive relationship ($x$ and $y$ increase together) and $r < 0$ a negative relationship ($x$ increases as $y$ decreases). When $|r| = 1$, there is a perfect *linear* relationship, while if $r = 0$ there is no *linear* relationship ($r$ may fail to capture non-linear relationships). In practice, $r$ is never exactly 0, so $r$ with small magnitude are synonymous with \"no correlation\". $|r| = 1$ does occur, usually when two variables effectively describe the same phenomena (for example, height in meters vs. height in centimeters, or grocery bill and sales tax).\n",

    "The Boston housing prices dataset is included with **sklearn** as a \"toy\" dataset (one used to experiment with statistical and machine learning methods). It includes the results of a survey that prices houses from various areas of Boston, and includes variables such as the crime rate of an area, the age of the home owners, and other variables. While many applications focus on predicting the price of housing based on these variables, I'm only interested in the correlation between these variables (perhaps this will suggest a model later).\n",
