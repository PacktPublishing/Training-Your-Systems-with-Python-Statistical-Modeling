    "In a city, 95% of cabs are owned by the Yellow Cab Company, and 5% are owned by Green Cab, Inc. Recently a cab was involved in a hit-and-run accident, injuring a pedestrian. A witness saw the accident and claimed that the cab that hit the pedestrian was a Green cab. Tests by investigators reveal that, under similar circumstances, this witness is correctly able to identify a Green cab 90% of the time, and correctly identify a Yellow cab 85% of the time; this means she incorrectly calls a Yellow cab a Green cab 15% of the time and incorrectly calls a Green cab a Yellow cab 10% of the time.\n",

    "$$P(H|D) = \\frac{P(D|H)P(H)}{P(D|H)P(H) + P(D|\\text{ not }H) P(\\text{not }H)} = \\frac{P(D|H)P(H)}{P(D)}$$\n",

    "Bayesian statisticians often emphasize the importance of the numerator by saying $P(H|D)$ is proportional to $P(D|H) P(H)$, or\n",

    "\n",
    "The denominator is needed only to make the right-hand side a proper probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $H$ represent the event that a Green cab hit the pedestrian, and $D$ the event that the witness claims to see a Green cab. Let's compute the probability that, given the witness's testimony, the pedestrian was actually hit by a Green cab."
