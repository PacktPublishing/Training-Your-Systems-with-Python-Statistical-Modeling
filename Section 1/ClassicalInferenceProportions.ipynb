    "\n",
    "In a sample of size $N$ there are $M$ \"successes\" (say, people who clicked on an advertisement) and $N - M$ \"failures\" (everyone else, who did not click on an advertisement). The **sample proportion** is then:\n",

    "$$\\hat{p} = \\frac{M}{N}$$\n",

We have an interval with a lower and upper bound and we believe that the true population proportion is within this interval with some level of confidence. For a 95% confidence interval, we are \"95% confident\" the true proportion is in the interval (in the sense that such intervals contain the population proportion 95% of the time).\n",
