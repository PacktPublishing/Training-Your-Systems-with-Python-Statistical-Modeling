R-squared` ($\\bar{R}^2$) since this takes into account how many variables are used. (it is impossible for $R^2$ to go down when adding variables even if those variables only contribute noise; $\\bar{R}^2$ doesn't have this property.) Here $\\bar{R}^2$ is somewhat high, suggesting that the model does a reasonable job at predicting home prices.\n",
    "* `F-statistic` is the test statistic for a statistical test to determine if any coefficients in the model are not zero. `Prob (F-statistic)` is the corresponding $p$-value. Here the model clearly has a non-zero coefficient, though the statistic does not say which.\n",
    "* `AIC` is the **Akaike information criterion (AIC)**, and `BIC` the **Bayesian information criterion (BIC)**. These are measures of the quality of statistical models and provide a means to decide between models. Models that lead to smaller AIC and BIC are seen as better.\n",
    "* The table contains the coefficients of the statistical model and the results of $t$-tests to determine if the coefficients are zero or not, in addition to confidence intervals for the coefficient values. We might consider removing features with coefficients not statistically different from zero from our model (but we should also refer to the AIC and BIC statistics when making decisions between models).\n",

Notice that in our table the third and seventh features don't have coefficients statistically different from zero (these correspond to proportion of non-retail business acres per town and proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940). Does a model without these features do better according to the AIC?"
