    "# Linear Models and OLS\n",
    "*Curtis Miller*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regression** refers to the prediction of a continuous variable (income, age, height, etc.) using a dataset's features. A **linear model** is a model of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + ... + \\beta_K x_K + \\epsilon$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $\\epsilon$ is an **error term**; the predicted value for $y$ is given by $\\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + ... + \\beta_K x_K$, so $y - \\hat{y} = \\epsilon$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\epsilon$ is almost never zero, so for regression we must measure \"accuracy\" differently. The **sum of squared errors (SSE)** is the sum $\\sum_{i = 1}^n (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2$ (letting $y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1,i} + \\beta_2 x_{2,i} + ... + \\beta_K x_{K,i} + \\epsilon_i$ and $\\hat{y}_i$ defined analogously). We might define the \"most accurate\" regression model as the model that minimizes the SSE. However, when measuring performance, the **mean squared error (MSE)** is often used. The MSE is given by $\\frac{\\text{SSE}}{n} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ordinary least squares (OLS)** is a procedure for finding a linear model that minimizes the SSE on a dataset. This is the simplest procedure for fitting a linear model on a dataset. To evaluate the model's performance we may split a dataset into training and test set, and evaluate the trained model's performance by computing the MSE of the model's predictions on the test set. If the model has a high MSE on both the training and test set, it's underfitting. If it has a small MSE on the training set and a high MSE on the test set, it is overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "With OLS the most important decision is which features to use in prediction and how to use them. \"Linear\" means linear in coefficients only; these models can handle many kinds of functions. (The models $\\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\beta_2 x^2$ and $\\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\log(x)$ are linear, but $\\hat{y} = \\frac{\\beta_0}{1 + \\beta_1 x}$ is not.) Many approaches exist for deciding which features to include. For now we will only use cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fitting a Linear Model with OLS\n",
    "\n",
    "OLS is supported by the `LinearRegression` object in **scikit-learn**, while the function `mean_squared_error()` computes the MSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be using OLS to find a linear model for predicting home prices in the Boston house price dataset, created below."
