    "\n",
    "**Principle component analysis (PCA)** is a dimensionality reduction technique that finds a feature space such that all features are uncorrelated with each other. Furthermore, the first feature is a linear combination of the observed features that maximizes the variance without \"magnifying\" those features effects. The second feature maximizes variance when the effect of the first feature has been removed from the dataset, and so on, so each feature \"explains\" a diminishing amount of variation in the original dataset. Dimensionality is thus reduced by choosing a smaller number of features found by PCA that account for most of the variation in the original dataset.\n",
